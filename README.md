This is just one of many refreshers on the TOP lessons.  This will serve as the 'alternate' version.

~I probably will do the same subject matter, I might change it.  Who knows?~

As a refresher, I will list the skills I relearn here :

  - basic HTML 
  - HTML formatting
  - linking to other pages in the same directory
  - image placement and alignment

I also gave it some thought about using original content, but decided to just use the previous lesson of content instead.  My reason is **a)** I'm already taking too long to get this going and **b)** it's already there, I'm doing it as an exercise to refresh my memory

The finished product:
