		 <p>
			 This one is a bit more complicated, as it requires a little more preparation with the gathering of some not-too-common 
  spices, like cardamon.  The result will not be an ordinary cup o' joe, but a flavorful experience.
  </p>
  <h4>Ingredients :</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>32 oz of water (enough for about 4 cups)</li>
			<li>1/2 cup of dark roasted coffee grounds (about 1/8 cup per serving)</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon ground black peppercorns</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon ginger</li>
			<li>1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom pods</li>
			<li>1/8 teaspoon ground clove</li>
			<li>Milk (optional)</li>
			<li>Sugar (also optional)</li>
		</ul>
  <p></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Start by preparing your coffee as normal</li>
			<li>Add the pre-ground spices to the coffee grounds.  Brew the coffee as usual</li>
			<li>If you are adding milk, pour enough into a saucepan for the desired number of cups, about 1/8 to 1/4 for each cup.  
        Heat the milk until hot, but not boiling.  <p>If no milk, skip this step</p></li>
			<li>When the coffee is ready, pour into cups and add the hot milk and sugar to taste.  For a truly authentic flavor, 
        try it with a little bit of milk but no sugar, to enjoy the natural mix of flavors present</li>
		</ol>
