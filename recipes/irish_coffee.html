    <h1>Irish Coffee</h1>
    <img src="../pix/irish_coffee_mug.jpg">
    <p>This just has four simple ingredients to use, so it can be made fairly quick.  It also pairs well with
			rolling green hills and cold foggy mornings!</p>
		<h4>Ingredients :</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>1 1/2 onces of your favorite whiskey</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon of brown sugar</li>
				<li>1 cup of freshly brewed coffee, 6 - 8 onces</li>
				<li>Heavy cream, slightly whipped</li>
				<li>Tea kettle of near boiling water (optional)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ol>
				<li>If you are using the tea kettle, get the water hot first and pour it into the cup.  Let stand for
         about a minute, and discard the water.</li>
        <li>Pour about 2/3 of the coffee in to the cup, and add the brown sugar.  Stir until disolved and 
        pour in the rest of the coffee</li>
        <li>Pour in the whiskey and stir gently</li>
        <li>Gently pour the heavy cream over the back of a spoon, into the hot coffee.  This will help the 
        cream float on top of the coffee.  Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>* This is served tradionally in a stemmed mug (see picture)</p>
